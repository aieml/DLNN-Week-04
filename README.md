# DLNN-Week-04
This week we discussed about Convolution Neural Networks. And started building up a simple CNN model for detecting cats and dogs.

## Updated codes

Please refer ```python 2.0 cats&dogs creating dataset.ipynb``` for the updated code of dataset creation

Please refer ```2.1 cat&dog training CNN.ipynb``` for the training of CNN for detecting cats and dogs of given in 50x50 images
